I use cuDTW++ (Ultra-Fast Dynamic Time Warping on CUDA-enabled GPUs: https://github.com/asbschmidt/cuDTW) to calculate the DTW between a target time series and multiple sequences.
I use script crtDTWvrbs.py in folder config to modify two files in folder cuDTW to set up cuDTW++ to calculate DTW with any number of sequences(in data folder) of any length and a target(in data folder) of any length.
